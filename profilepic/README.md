##  (Command-Line Tool) Usage

The gem includes a command line tool named - surprise, surpirse - `profilepic`
that lets you run a zero-config / out-of-the-box profile pic(ture) as a service.  Type:

    $ profilepic

That will start-up a (local loopback) web server / service running on port 3000.  
Open-up up the index page in your browser to get started e.g. <http://localhost:3000/>. 

That's it.
